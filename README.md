Single-page experience that uses p5.js and ml5 face tracking to drive audio from mouth openness.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – produce a production build in `dist`
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally

Legacy orchestrator/player variants have been removed to avoid conflicts; the app now renders only the face-controlled page.
